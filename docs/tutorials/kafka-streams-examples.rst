Kafka Streams Examples
----------------------

In this tutorial we will run Confluent's
:cp-examples:`Kafka Music demo application|src/main/java/io/confluent/examples/streams/interactivequeries/kafkamusic/KafkaMusicExample.java`
for the Kafka Streams API.

The Kafka Music application demonstrates how to build of a simple music charts application that continuously computes,
in real-time, the latest charts such as Top 5 songs per music genre.  It exposes its latest processing results -- the
latest charts -- via Kafka's :ref:`Interactive Queries <streams_developer-guide_interactive-queries>` feature and a REST
API.  The application's input data is in Avro format and comes from two sources: a stream of play events (think: "song
X was played") and a stream of song metadata ("song X was written by artist Y");  see
:ref:`inspecting the input data <docker-tutorial_kafka-streams-examples_inspect-input-data>` in the
:ref:`Appendix <docker-tutorial_kafka-streams-examples_appendix>` for how the input data looks like.

More specifically, we will run the following services:

- Confluent's
  :cp-examples:`Kafka Music demo application|src/main/java/io/confluent/examples/streams/interactivequeries/kafkamusic/KafkaMusicExample.java`
- a single-node Kafka cluster with a single-node ZooKeeper ensemble
- :ref:`Confluent Schema Registry <schemaregistry_intro>`


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`__.

* You must install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`__ and
  `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__.
* The Confluent Docker images require Docker version 1.11 or greater.


Running the Kafka Music demo application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to see an appetizer of what we will do in this section, take a look at the following screencast:

      <strong>Screencast: Running Confluent's Kafka Music demo application (3 mins)</strong>
    </a>
  </p>

Ready now?  Let's start!

.. note::

    **Mac users only:** Create and configure the Docker Machine

    .. sourcecode:: bash

      # If you haven't done so, create a VM with 6GB of memory
      # as your Docker Machine and name it `confluent`.
      $ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 6000 confluent

      # Next, configure your terminal window to attach it to your new Docker Machine.
      $ eval $(docker-machine env confluent)


Clone the Confluent Docker Images repository:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    # Clone the git repository
    $ git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images

    # Change into the directory for this tutorial
    $ cd cp-docker-images/examples/kafka-streams-examples

    # Switch to the `master` branch
    $ git checkout master

Now we can launch the Kafka Music demo application including the services it depends on such as Kafka.

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    $ docker-compose up -d

After a few seconds the application and the services are up and running.  One of the started containers is continuously
generating input data for the application by writing into its input topics.  This allows us to look at live, real-time
data when playing around with the Kafka Music application.

Now we can use our web browser or a CLI tool such as ``curl`` to interactively query the latest processing results of
the Kafka Music application by accessing its REST API.

**REST API example 1: list all running application instances of the Kafka Music application:**

.. sourcecode:: bash

    # Mac users
    $ curl -sXGET http://`docker-machine ip confluent`:7070/kafka-music/instances

    # Linux users
    $ curl -sXGET http://localhost:7070/kafka-music/instances

    # You should see output similar to following, though here
    # the output is pretty-printed so that it's easier to read:
    [
      {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 7070,
        "storeNames": [
          "all-songs",
          "song-play-count",
          "top-five-songs",
          "top-five-songs-by-genre"
        ]
      }
    ]

**REST API example 2: get the latest Top 5 songs across all music genres:**

.. sourcecode:: bash

    # Mac and Windows users
    $ curl -sXGET http://`docker-machine ip confluent`:7070/kafka-music/charts/top-five

    # Linux users
    $ curl -sXGET http://localhost:7070/kafka-music/charts/top-five

    # You should see output similar to following, though here
    # the output is pretty-printed so that it's easier to read:
    [
      {
        "artist": "Jello Biafra And The Guantanamo School Of Medicine",
        "album": "The Audacity Of Hype",
        "name": "Three Strikes",
        "plays": 70
      },
      {
        "artist": "Hilltop Hoods",
        "album": "The Calling",
        "name": "The Calling",
        "plays": 67
      },

      ... rest omitted...
    ]

The REST API exposed by the
:cp-examples:`Kafka Music application|src/main/java/io/confluent/examples/streams/interactivequeries/kafkamusic/KafkaMusicExample.java`
supports further operations.  See the
:cp-examples:`top-level instructions in its source code|src/main/java/io/confluent/examples/streams/interactivequeries/kafkamusic/KafkaMusicExample.java`
for details.

Once you're done playing around you can stop all the services and containers with:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ docker-compose down

We hope you enjoyed this tutorial!


Running further Confluent demo applications for the Kafka Streams API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The container named ``kafka-music-application``, which runs the Kafka Music demo application, actually contains all of
Confluent's `Kafka Streams demo applications <https://github.com/confluentinc/examples>`__.  The demo applications are
packaged in the fat jar at ``/app/streams-examples-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`` inside this container.
This means you can easily run any of these applications from inside the container via a command similar to:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    # Example: Launch the WordCount demo application (inside the `kafka-music-application` container)
    $ docker-compose exec kafka-music-application \
            java -cp /app/streams-examples-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar \
            io.confluent.examples.streams.WordCountLambdaExample \
            localhost:29092

Of course you can also modify the tutorial's ``docker-compose.yml`` for repeatable deployments.

Note that you must follow the full instructions of each demo application (see its respective source code at
https://github.com/confluentinc/examples).  These instructions include, for example, the creation of the application's
input and output topics.  Also, each demo application supports CLI arguments.  Typically, the first CLI argument is
the ``bootstrap.servers`` parameter and the second argument, if any, is the ``schema.registry.url`` setting.

Available endpoints **from within the containers**:

+---------------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| Endpoint                  | Parameter               | Value                     |
+===========================+=========================+===========================+
| Kafka Cluster             | ``bootstrap.servers``   | ``localhost:29092``       |
+---------------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| Confluent Schema Registry | ``schema.registry.url`` | ``http://localhost:8081`` |
+---------------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| ZooKeeper ensemble        | ``zookeeper.connect``   | ``localhost:32181``       |
+---------------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------+

The ZooKeeper endpoint is not required by Kafka Streams applications, but you need it to e.g.
:ref:`manually create new Kafka topics <docker-tutorial_kafka-streams-examples_topics-create>` or to
:ref:`list available Kafka topics <docker-tutorial_kafka-streams-examples_topics-list>`.

Lastly, if you want to interact with the Kafka broker *from your host*, then on operating systems that require the use
of Docker Machine (Mac OS and Windows OS) you must first override the environment variable ``KAFKA_ADVERTISED_IP`` to
the IP address of the Docker Machine VM before starting the services via ``docker-compose up -d``:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    # Set `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_IP` to the IP address of the Docker Machine if the latter is actually available.
    $ KAFKA_ADVERTISED_IP=`docker-machine ip confluent 2>/dev/null || echo localhost` docker-compose up -d

You do not need to override the environment variable for interacting with other services such as ZooKeeper or Confluent
Schema Registry.  See the tutorial's ``docker-compose.yml`` for further information.

Creating new topics
"""""""""""""""""""

You can create topics manually with the ``kafka-topics`` CLI tool, which is available on the ``kafka`` container.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   # Create a new topic named "my-new-topic", using the `kafka` container
   $ docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics \
       --zookeeper localhost:32181 \
       --create --topic my-new-topic --partitions 2 --replication-factor 1

  # You should see a line similar to:
  Created topic "my-new-topic".


.. _docker-tutorial_kafka-streams-examples_topics-list:

Listing available topics
""""""""""""""""""""""""

You can list all available topics with the ``kafka-topics`` CLI tool, which is available on the ``kafka`` container.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   # Create a new topic named "my-new-topic", using the `kafka` container
   $ docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics \
       --zookeeper localhost:32181 \
       --list

Additional topic information is displayed by running ``--describe`` instead of ``-list``.
